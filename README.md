# fastfeathers
collection of bash-shell scripts to run various feathers example quickly

to-do:
when sequelize-grid EDITS, the new email address is NOT displaying in the lastUpdatedBy in the window that made the change - value is indeed correct in the db

1) mark@comptonpeslonline creates record
2) mark@edwardsmark alters record in browserstack
3) mark@edwardsmark does NOT show up in 'last updated by' in browserstack

delete does not necessarily work - test

These scripts has been tested on the following:
1)  digitalocean droplets (cent0s7)
2)  google.cloud.google.com (centos7)  
3)  amazon ec2 RHEL
